# Example environment variables for ZLR

# --- Obsidian Integration (Required for Obsidian export features) ---
# Path to your Obsidian vault. ZLR will create notes in <OBSIDIAN_VAULT>/zlr-inbox/
# OBSIDIAN_VAULT=/path/to/your/obsidian/vault
# OBSIDIAN_VAULT=C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\ObsidianVault

# --- Watch Folder (Optional, for zlr watch command) ---
# Path to the folder ZLR should monitor for new PDF files.
# If not set, the default in src/extract/config.py will be used (e.g., project_root/watch_folder_sample).
# ZLR_WATCH_FOLDER=/path/to/your/pdf_watch_folder

# --- Database Path (Optional) ---
# Path to the SQLite database file.
# If not set, defaults to <project_root>/zlr.sqlite as defined in src/extract/config.py.
# DB_PATH=/custom/path/to/your/zlr_database.sqlite

# --- PDF Path (Optional, primarily for development/testing via config.py) ---
# Default PDF to process if no PDF is specified on the command line (used by some internal logic if config.PDF_PATH is directly used).
# Generally, you will provide PDF paths as arguments to `zlr extract`.
# PDF_PATH=sample_pdfs/my_default_document.pdf
